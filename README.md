StorageTapper
--------------

StorageTapper is a scalable realtime MySQL change data streaming and
transformation service.

Service reads data from MySQL, transforms it into an Avro schema
serialized format, and publishes these events to Kafka. Consumers can then
consume these events directly from Kafka.

Build & Install
---------------

## Get build dependencies
```sh
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
go get github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter
```

It's recommended to have local MySQL and Kafka installed, so as many tests
depend on them. Tweak [development config](./config/development.yaml) to
correspond your setup.
**WARNING**: Tests run dangerous commands like RESET MASTER and DROP
DATABASE, so for tests don't use any MySQL instances with precious data.

## Debian & Ubuntu
```sh
cd storagetapper
make deb && dpkg -i ../storagetapper_1.0_amd64.deb
```

## Others
```sh
cd storagetapper
make test && make install
```
